# smart_walking_stick
Microcontroller based Hardware &amp; Firmware providing the obstacle detection and collision avoidance through Alarms (Vibratory, Auditory) and also provides the Fire detection &amp; alarm. 
The obstacle detection is done using an ultrasonic sensor and an indication of an
obstacle's distance from the stick is given by an Eccentric rotating mass motor
(ERM MOTOR i.e vibration motor), which produces vibrations and a buzzer, which
buzzes with different frequencies depending on the distance between the stick and
the obstacle.
The device has an added feature of flame detection. A flame sensor module is
used to detect the presence of flames, and the buzzer emits a specific sound to
indicate this.
The microcontroller Arduino UNO integrates, programs and controls all the
components of the project. In simple terms, it is the brain of the whole system.
Finally, the entire circuitry is placed on a robust Aluminium rod equipped with a
handle.
